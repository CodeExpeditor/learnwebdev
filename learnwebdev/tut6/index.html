        <p1> Trying to understand the overarching narrative of the Assassin's Creed series and how they connect to each other is as intimidating as it can be difficult. We'll help make the process as painless as possible. If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game before and you're looking to get into the franchise, here's the story so far.<br><br>For the purposes of this article, we'll be delving into the main Assassin's Creed games only. The series makes up some of the best Xbox games, in my opinion, but it also has some duds. The franchise also has several long-running comic series and spin-off games that continue the meta-narrative; however, it's unreasonable to assume everyone should go out and buy all of them, though Ubisoft oddly tied up important storylines outside of the games we'll briefly touch upon in the modern-day section. </p1>
